            <p>I am a Marketing Manager at Amazon Business. My role focuses on email marketing and CRM, two roles that play a significant role in retrieving new customers and keeping them. 
            I've brought my talents to many notable companies and brands, such as TD Garden, 401 Tech Bridge, NCAA, and currently, Amazon Business. My work has been acknowledged in the 
            2021 Rhode Island Inno 5 Under 25 story where I am recognized for my outstanding work in making 401 Tech Bridge a notable and respected name in the state of Rhode Island.</p>

                <li><em>Received my Google Analytics Individual Qualification (GAIQ) in August of 2022. I have acquired the skills to efficiently launch
                    and manage Google Analytic campaigns. This skill can help your business gather insight on website traffic, session duration, bounce rate, and more.
                    With the data gathered from these campaigns, I can assess websites and improve user experience, run ads for passive revenue, and increase the website's SEO 
                     performance. Additionally, I can pass this information along to employers and colleagues.</em></li>
